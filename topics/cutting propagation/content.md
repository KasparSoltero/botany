### How to take cuttings
- Sunrise is the best time when plants are fully hydrated.
- Use sharp secateurs.
- Find a non-flowering stem.
- Cut 7-10cm of plant, from just below the node.
- Remove leaves to reduce transpiration (loss of water). Retain enough leaves for photosynthesis.
- Keep cutting moist, cool, shaded (damp plastic bag).  

### How to grow cuttings
- Use a medium that's low in nutrients with good aeration and drainage, moist but not wet.
- Dip cuttings into rooting hormone.
- Insert cutting 1/3 into soil medium.
- Maintain humidity by placing a plastic bag over the cuttings.
- Keep in a cool, humid place with medium light.
